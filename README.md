# Fotofolio
***Super simple photography showcase***

This is Fotofolio. It's a Python-based app that turns photos and text files into a sleek portfolio website. 



On Fotofolio, your website lives in the *content* folder and exists of markdown text files (like this one!) and folders of jpg images. There are no sub-pages, there is no in-depth navigation. Just photo's and text files.

The only required file is `index.md`. This is your home page.

Fotofolio shows a title and optional description for each image. The title is simply the filename of the jpg file. The description is the IPTC Description in the photo's metadata. You can set this using Adobe Lightroom or a similar program.

A fancy background image for all text pages can be set by adding it to the static/img folder and naming it `homebg.jpg`.
